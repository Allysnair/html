	<h3><i>Hybrid work models provide the best of both worlds and offer the flexibility of remote working/working from home/working from anywhere.</i></h3>

	<p style="font-family: courier new;">Post pandemic, the working models of companies have not changed much. While some companies are choosing office-first or remote-friendly options for their employees, some are offering partly remote hybrid, flexible hybrid, partly remote hybrid, choose-your-own-adventure hybrid, remote-first hybrid, and full remote models. Each of them has its own pros and cons. </p>

    <p style="font-family: courier new;">Simultaneously, with the rising attrition,<b> the Indian IT companies</b> are still figuring out working models that work for them, as well as their employees.</p>

    <h3>Impact on attrition </h3><br>
    <p style="font-family: courier new;">Happiest Minds’ Khurana said that the transition towards the hybrid work model has greatly helped in the team’s engagement and collaboration activities. He said that the attrition in the industry remained elevated over the last few quarters. “However, we do not see the attrition rate being impacted by our shift to a hybrid work model,” said Khurana, claiming that the response from their members has been very encouraging.</p><br><br>

	<p style="font-family: courier new;">Zuci Systems’ Veerachamy said that they had focused on people-centricity in line with their engineering philosophy that calls for enabling a creative ecosystem, including internal stakeholders. He further said that it did not witness an undesired material impact on their attrition rates. “Our attrition has been around 8-10 per cent, and we can see a drop of 15-20 per cent in the recent months. Compare this with the reported attrition rate of listed peers, that are typically in the range of 18-24 per cent.” </p><br><br>
